0x02. Minimum Operations
Algorithm
Python

Here I covered all the resources that could help find solutions to complex problems using sub-structures of the problem. The concepts I studies are:
* Dynamic Programming
* Prime Factorization
* Code Optimization
* Greedy Algorithms
* Basic Python Programming
